									<h2>Abstract</h2>

									<p>Our group X Marks The Plot, including the members of Arjin Unlu, Danielle Walder, Gabi Laxer, Mathias Heldbo, Shane Puthuparambil and Sophia Chadsey, focused our efforts into researching community gardens, delving into issues of food insecurity and policies relating to the process. Food insecurity is defined as “limited or uncertain access to adequate food to lead a healthy life”, issues of this often permeate low-income communities. Additionally, many individuals with food hardship also experience health issues related to nutrition, like diabetes and high blood pressure. As Alameda Community Food Bank reports, “it takes a family of four $92,267 to meet the basics in the Oakland metro area. Yet 65 percent of our clients have incomes less than $28,290.” Therefore, these income inequalities make it “especially difficult for working families to afford basic necessities such as housing, utilities and transportation, let alone put a healthy meal on the table.” In an attempt to address solutions for food security and food sovereignty within Alameda county, we created a website to facilitate the development of urban gardens that grow culturally specific foods to communities with limited access to healthy foods.
									</p>
		<p>Our website includes the following components:
			<br>(1) Mapping of areas of food insecurity from the most severe (40-60% residents experiencing food hardship and hunger) to moderate insecurity (10-19%) using Alameda Food Bank data from 2019. </br>
			(2) Existing urban garden locations.
			<br>(3) Initiatives and policies for establishing new urban gardens.</br>
			(4) Benefits of building urban gardens.
			<br>(5) identifying vacant lots for urban garden opportunities.</br></p>

			<p>Using these components the website provides education and access to address hunger and food insecurity in Alameda county. We aim to provide the tools and resources for community leaders and those interested in growing their own food to reclaim cultural foodways and control of their means to healthy foods.
	By creating a map of food insecurity overlaid with community garden resources, we noticed trends where many food insecure locations had the least access to community garden resources. For example, many parts of inner city Oakland had food insecurity rates greater than 50%, yet little to no access to community gardens. Berkeley and Albany had a much higher concentration of community gardens than inner Oakland - this may have to do with a lack of targeted resources to majority BIPOC communities in the inner city. In addition to the relationship with food insecurity and community gardens, the (Group name) also analyzed vacant lot locations to identify opportunities for expansion of community gardens to strengthen community food systems and garden networks. Several lots exist in the upper hills parts of Oakland along with east Oakland where few community gardens currently exist. We have identified these plots for community or government investment in garden networks that can support food insecure neighborhoods. In Berkeley, the Smith Fernwald property which is owned by UC Berkeley and encompasses 9.26 acres of land next to Clark Kerr Campus may be an ideal location to begin a large community garden. Given the high number of people experiencing food insecurity in Berkeley, this property could be repurposed for a UC Berkeley community garden. The community garden can then be used to support UC Berkeley students and Berkeley residents suffering from food insecurity while teaching students and local residents about food sovereignty and the benefits of locally grown produce.

									<h2>Community Garden Tips</h2>

									<p>Community gardens would not be able to survive without the dedication of a group of people. Local and indigenous people to the area can provide you with resources and knowledge of the land and proper practices that will bring the power back into these farming communities and decolonize the food systems. Once you have brought together a group of people willing and dedicated to help out, it is time to consider the practices used in your garden. More sustainable practices will help create a more self-sustainable garden. Here are some practices to help with the creation of your community garden!

									<br>(1) Grow native plants with the help of native communities in order to foster thriving practices that will allow for the land to continue to produce amazing healthy foods.</br>
										(2) Re-use! Re-using organic materials and creating systems for gathering resources can help provide for the demand wielded by community gardens. This can mean creating a community compost in which people bring their scraps and other materials that they are no longer using for the community garden. This is not limited to food scraps, and can be wood used for plants or old clothes or household items.</br>
											(3) Sustainability! Sustainable practices, such as the ones talked about in the re-use portion can provide resources needed for the garden. One important resource needed to sustain a garden is water, something that can grow to be expensive and a resource that everyone should have access to. Collecting rainwater in buckets or through drip water irrigation systems can provide the water needed to cultivate a garden.</br>
											(4) Creating a welcoming environment. Education is a powerful tool for spreading your message and having people involved and informed to carry on a legacy. A community garden should provide access and education to those interested in those who want to help make a difference.</br>

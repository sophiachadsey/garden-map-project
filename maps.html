									<h2>Overall Map Description</h2>

									<p>With this community map, we aimed to create a comprehensive list of community gardens and vacant lots for potential community garden expansion in the East Bay area to support our local food system and combat food insecurity. All of these components are placed over a food insecurity map of the same region. The purpose of this is to show where community gardens are most important and most needed.

<h2>Legend</h2>

<h6><font color=#b6d691>(color a - Light Green) </font></h6>- Currently existing community gardens located through Google Maps and community newsletters.

<br><h6><font color=#a0454f>(color b - Dark Red)</font> </h6>- These are vacant lots which fit the criteria of being larger than 7500 sq. ft. and cost less than $200,000 USD to purchase.

<br><h6><font color=#f2a96a>(color c - Orange)</font></h6> - Vacant lots in areas without community gardens or vacant lots that are not within the preferred sq. ft. or price range. These properties were selected because of their locations, and due to their slightly higher price or slightly lower sq. footage, which is still suitable for a community garden.

<br><h6><font color=#aed7fc>(color d - Blue) </font></h6>- Smith Fernwald property. This property is owned by UC Berkeley and encompasses 9.26 acres of land, right next to Clark Kerr Campus. The lands of this property have primarily been left to grow, and serves no current purpose. We therefore thought, given the high number of people experiencing food insecurity in Berkeley, that this property could be repurposed for a UC Berkeley community garden. This community garden can then be used to support UC Berkeley students and Berkeley residents suffering from food insecurity while teaching students and local residents about food sovereignty and the benefits of locally produced produce.

<br>Polygons - Each polygon (area shaded with color) represents the regionâ€™s food insecurity rating, a percent measurement of the number of food insecure households within the area. These ratings were sourced from the Alameda Food Bank from 2019. </p>

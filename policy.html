									<h2>An Analysis of Local and Statewide Policies and Organizations: Those Who Promote Existence of Community Garden Initiatives</h2>

									<p>


<p style="text-indent: 40px">In order to promote transparency and inform individuals on their ability to access and participate in community gardens, we believe a clear outline related to policies and other state-sponsored programs is incredibly beneficial.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Finding a multitude of resources at both state and local levels, our research outlines various programs. No matter what level of understanding one has regarding efforts of community gardens, a strong basis in the rights they hold as citizens is essential. Therefore, by establishing consensus for fundamental rights we are entitled to, we understand how we can go about creating urban spaces of agriculture in the form of community gardens.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">First, we bring great attention to Assembly Bill 551, a 2013 California General Assembly legislation which allows for a county or city to “establish an Urban Agriculture Incentive Zone (UAIZ) for the purpose of supporting local food production”. It also allowed the Secretary of the State and Consumer Services Agency, a prior agency in the executive branch of California’s government to create “facilitation programs to support organizations that develop community gardens”. Furthermore, the Bill restricts the “use of vacant, unimproved, or otherwise blighted lands for small-scale production of agricultural crops and animal husbandry”.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">This act provides great prospects for creating and maintaining community garden spaces. As a Backyard Roots article on Vacant Lot Gardens in Oakland includes, AB 551 could “really make a difference in Oakland where there are “337 acres of privately owned land” that could be used for growing food”. Therefore, our group project keeps such figures in mind, mapping lots which could apply to the Bill’s language in our project. We find these affordable lots, with abilities to grow fresh produce and connect communities with agricultural systems to be great prospects for fostering community development and combating Bay Area food insecurity. Additionally, we believe it is important to provide incentives for community agricultural land use, particularly within urban areas, and emphasize the value in utilizing existing policy to create spaces of change.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Turning to another resource available in the fight for creating and maintaining community gardens, we present Assembly Bill 2561, The Neighborhood Food Act which permits “tenants of single family or duplex homes” to grow food in “containers that are approved by their landlords”. It is a significant legislative effort, as “renters and members of a Homeowners Association (HOA)” who were previously unable to cultivate and produce personal crops on their land are now given the opportunity. Therefore, it increases the ability for those to engage in agriculture efforts, and promotes urban gardening despite one's living situation.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Overall, Oakland city planning codes are quite lenient in efforts to produce urban agriculture. The 2014 unanimous City Council change allows for residents to cultivate crops in most city zones “without the requirement of attaining a special permit”. Increasing the feasibility of interested individuals to engage in agricultural projects, this update encourages opportunity and removes previous obstacles.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Moreover, we believe it is important to highlight local level offerings to efforts of food justice. For example, the Berkeley Community Gardening Collaborative assists neighborhoods through offering services of “resource and tool sharing contacts”, “technical advice, troubleshooting, and design assistance”, and “compost and seeds to community, school, and nonprofit projects”. In an effort to provide access to healthy food for all local community members, this organization is a great resource in facilitating formations of new garden spaces, and assisting and protecting pre-existing ones.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lastly, we believe it is important to pinpoint existing national-level efforts in promoting urban agriculture. For example, The National Policy & Legal Analysis Network to Prevent Childhood Obesity’s 2011 report on Seeding the City Land Use Policies to Promote Urban Agriculture has sections on “developing urban agriculture land use policy”, “preserving urban agriculture”, “other laws affecting urban agriculture”, and models on language planning and zoning ordinances. We believe this resource is incredibly useful for aspiring urban agriculture groups, and brings transparency and understanding to a multitude of issues which may present themselves in efforts to bring about community gardens. Additionally, The National Recreation and Park Association’s piece on Building A Community Garden In Your Park details steps on building garden communities, making them “accessible and inclusive” spaces and overcoming frequently encountered challenges. These two resources are great materials for those with further interest in developing community gardens.

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Overall, we believe that encouraging urban agriculture efforts foster positive “economic, social, and ecological change”. Bridging the gap between traditionally inaccessible spaces, communities are able to create and enact changes for their own futures. We hope that our clarity and outlining of these various rights and resources proves beneficial in understanding how communities can create and maintain urban agricultural spaces, and are excited to facilitate such change.</p>
